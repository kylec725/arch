### Why Eat?

- have to
  - physiological response
  - hunger
- want to
  - psycho-social response
  - appetite
  - stress, habit, special occasions, social norms

### Hunger (Physiological Response)

- the hypothalamus regulates hunger
- hormones
  - **Ghrelin** from stomach, a major physiological hunger signal
  - **Leptin** from adipose (fat) tissue, suppresses the desire to eat
  - **Neuropeptide Y** from hypothalamus - a neurotransmitter
- Other factors affecting hunger
  - composition of meals - fiber and water more filling, high protein vs high carbohydrates
  - income, population size (distribution/availability of food)
  - natural environment
  - technology available for food
- psycho-social response - can be a reward, coping device, or stress reliever

### Classes of Nutrients

- macro-nutrients
  - proteins
  - carbohydrates
  - lipids (fats)
- micro-nutrients
  - vitamins
  - minerals
  - water

**Kilocalorie (kcal) - unit of energy (heat)**

- Proteins
- Carbohydrates
- Fat (has more than the other two)
- Alcochol (less than fat but more than proteins and carbohydrates)
- Vitamins, minerals, and water do not provide energy

**Bomb Calorimeter** is used to measure calories in food

Adults are usually recommended to have less fat than adolescents

Some foods may contain beneficial non-nutrients called **phytochemicals**

### Diets

**Ketogenic Diet** (fad diet?)

Uses **Ketosis** a state where you body mainly metabolizes fat for energy

Ketosis can happen naturally:

- after exercising for a long time
- during pregnancy
- uncontrolled diabetes (sign of not using enough insulin)
- consequence of very low carbohydrate diet
