## Transactions

Use web-hooks - create separate table of pending user accounts

1. charge card and deposit into user account (card/bank -> pending -> user account)
2. transfer from user account into another (user account -> destination account)
3. withdraw user account funds (user account -> pending -> bank)
4. "directly" charge card, deposit into user account, then transfer to destination account (card/bank -> pending -> user account -> destination account)

## Updates

- Update/remove cards and bank accounts
- Payouts with bank accounts/debit cards
- Delete "customer" accounts

## Grant Accounts
