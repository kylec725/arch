### Why Eat?

- have to
  - physiological response
  - hunger
- want to
  - psycho-social response
  - appetite
  - stress, habit, special occasions, social norms

### Hunger (Physiological Response)

- the hypothalamus regulates hunger
- hormones
  - **Ghrelin** from stomach, a major physiological hunger signal
  - **Leptin** from adipose (fat) tissue, suppresses the desire to eat
  - **Neuropeptide Y** from hypothalamus - a neurotransmitter
- Other factors affecting hunger
  - composition of meals - fiber and water more filling, high protein vs high carbohydrates
  - income, population size (distribution/availability of food)
  - natural environment
  - technology available for food
- psycho-social response - can be a reward, coping device, or stress reliever

### Classes of Nutrients

- macro-nutrients
  - proteins
  - carbohydrates
  - lipids (fats)
- micro-nutrients
  - vitamins
  - minerals
  - water

**Kilocalorie (kcal) - unit of energy (heat)**

- Proteins
- Carbohydrates
- Fat (has more than the other two)
- Alcochol (less than fat but more than proteins and carbohydrates)
- Vitamins, minerals, and water do not provide energy

**Bomb Calorimeter** is used to measure calories in food

Adults are usually recommended to have less fat than adolescents

Some foods may contain beneficial non-nutrients called **phytochemicals**

### Diets

**Ketogenic Diet** (fad diet?)

Uses **Ketosis** a state where you body mainly metabolizes fat for energy

Ketosis can happen naturally:

- after exercising for a long time
- during pregnancy
- uncontrolled diabetes (sign of not using enough insulin)
- consequence of very low carbohydrate diet

**Testing Nutrition of Foods**

- often people disagree on how to test for the nutrition values of foods
- most people don't know how to even start testing food

**Key to evaluate nutrition information**:

1. Credibility and source of information
2. Research Methodology
   - Study design, statistical methods
   - Limitations
3. Target Group
   - Which population groups are most affected by the findings?

**Case Reports / Case Series**

- Generally report a new or unique finding from a presentation of a single case
- Advantages
  * useful for hypothesis generation
  * informative for very rare diseases
  * characterizes averages for disorder
- Disadvantages
  - Cannot study cause/effect relationships
  - Cannot assess disease frequency
- Case Report: one case of unusual findings
- Case Series: multiple cases of findings

**Descriptive Epidemiology Study**: population-based cases with denominator

**Observational Studies**:

- non-experimental
- individuals can be observed prospectively, retrospectively, or currently
- can generate hypothesis, should not draw any conclusions usually however

**Cross-sectional Studies**: "observational" design that looks at a disease's status at a single point in time

**Case-control Studies**:

- "observational" design that compares exposure between disease cases vs healthy controls form the same population
- Exposure data is collected retrospectively, thus some information may be inaccurate as it is provided by the subjects
- most feasible design where disease outcomes are rare
- can be thrown off when people in a group already have a predisposition to a certain disease

**Cohort Study**:

- "observational" design
- usually collect prospectively (sometimes retrospectively)
- compare two groups who do and do not have a condition (try to match them closely in age, general, and other key variables) otherwise, the differences can account for why someone has a given condition

### 06

**Experimental Studies**

- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
  - assign subjects randomly to "treatment" and "control" groups
  - most convincing way to prove causation
  - Clinical trials are the most well known experimental design and use randomly assigned data
  - Note: Community trials use non-random data
  - Disadvantages:
    - is usually expensive
    - may not be suitable to answer certain types of questions

### 09

**Obesity**

- Body Mass Index is generally used to determine obesity as it usually correlates with people being overweight
- Culture, diet, and poverty play roles in why countries' obesity rates are low or high
- *Social inequalities* are strong, especially among women. Less educated women are 2-3 times more likely to be overweight
