# TerpWushu Budget Notes

---

## Laptops

### Purchase Objective and Justification

During our annually hosted competition, University Wushu Games, we require the use of judging software. This software allows us to smoothly score each competitor's performance score as well as keep track of order of competitors. These programs are vital to keeping the competition running efficiently and in the past we have borrowed club members' laptops. Acquiring club laptops would ensure that we always have the required amount of laptops to run our tournament software as well as eliminate potential risk for our club members' property.



## CMAT Car Rentals

### Purchase Objective and Justification

The Chinese Martial Art Tournament (CMAT) allows TerpWushu to showcase our hard-work and training against some of the strongest competitors on the west coast. This competition is hosted by UC Berkeley and renting cars is essential to ensuring that we arrive to the competition on-time and ready to compete at our best ability.



## Collegiate Tournament Entry Fees

### Purchase Objective and Justification

The Collegiate Wushu Competition is one of the few wushu competitions that are held annually. As such, we believe that every member should have the opportunity to compete at this event. Collegiates charges a $50 entry fee for each competitor, and we do not want this entry fee to be a barrier to any of our members competing.



## CMAT Tournament Entry Fee

### Purchase Objective and Justification

During the years where the Collegiate Wushu Tournament is hosted in a drivable city, we fly to San Francisco, California to compete in UC Berkeley's Chinese Martial Art Tournament (CMAT). This tournament is one of the most well-known west coast wushu tournaments. It serves as an opportunity for our members to compete against some of the most skilled wushu athletes in the country and prepares them to compete in the Collegiate tournament later in the year. We hope to bring 30 people to CMAT in Spring 2020 if Collegiates is hosted on the east coast. The registration fees for this tournament are significant as it costs $50 for general registration and $15 for each subsequent event. We never want financial concerns to prevent one of our members from competing which is why we ask these fees to be funded. Additionally, this tournament will help our members further develop their wushu skills as well as prepare them to compete in other tournaments in the future.
