1. The opening of the Aeneid explains how Aeneas is at somewhat of a midpoint between the Iliad and the Odyssey. His tale expresses his lingering warfare anger as well as his long journey to establishing a new home. This mix of qualities presents him as a hero who must endure through a situation that is unique compared to the Iliad and Odyssey.
2. Hector's definition of heroism originally seemed to imply to earn glory through sacrifice in war. Yet to Achilles now, the idea of heroism seems more to have the strength to endure hardships and survive for the sake of your people. Staying alive allows Achilles to find his people new land in the form of what will eventually become Rome.
3. Roman readers may have been predisposed to dislike Dido as she symbolizes Carthage, and without Aeneas leaving her, Rome would have never been founded. Readers may have sympathized with her as his actions in the future result in the eventual destruction of Carthage by Rome.
