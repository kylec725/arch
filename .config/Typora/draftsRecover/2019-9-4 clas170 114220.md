**pregnancy envy**: the idea that men become envious when a women becomes pregnant with a child that is not theirs

**castration**

- separation of sky and earth
- myth and psychoanalysis
- the sickle (used by Gaia and Cronus against Ouranus)
- love and hate

**Cronus**

- the youngest child
- father time
- becomes sky god of the second generation
- Rhea becomes his wife, and by extension, the earth goddess of the second generation
- swallows his children, but now looks pregnant (done out of fear of his children)

**Zeus** 

*God of the Sky*

- Thunder and Lightning

Metis: Zeus's first wife, who's name means cunning

Swallows his children as he fears being overthrown like his father, but now looks pregnant

Eventually his wife, Rhea, tires of this and feeds a rock one day in place of Zeus

He is raised on Crete, a place that is extremely significant to the earth goddess. Essentially the opposite place that a sky god should belong

Eventually, Gaia does not like that Zeus has become powerful with the support of the earth. She sets the Titans against him and creates other monsters to oppose him.

*Key Points*

- Sky vs. Earth
- Strength vs. Intelligence
- Greeks vs. Barbarians
