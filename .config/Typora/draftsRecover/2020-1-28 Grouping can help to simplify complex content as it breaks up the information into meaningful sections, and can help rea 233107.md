Grouping can help to simplify complex content as it breaks up the information into meaningful sections, and can help readers ingest the information more quickly. This idea is quite intuitive as most curricula implement this strategy at a larger scale. For example, Calculus is split into different groups, as exposing students to the entire subject would simply be overwhelming. By grouping information well, readers can then identify each core concept that makes up the complex content, and then understand the content thoroughly. Creating this understanding of the content will then allow the reader to teach the information effectively to others, as they will then understand the relation between key concepts.
