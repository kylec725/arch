Since coming to UMD I've participated in a number of other clubs including TASA, KSA, Tianyi, and CP Diabolo, but if I had to choose one club that has had the greatest effect on me as an individual, it would have to be TerpWushu. Wushu as a sport has given and taken a lot from me both mentally and physically, and a granted me a new understanding of myself. I know now how I will put in however much time is necessary to improve, and I want to put the same work ethic into helping the club grow and function. I realize that the position of Treasurer requires a large amount of time and care to plan out the budget, trips, and concessions, but that sacrifice is absolutely worth it for TerpWushu.
