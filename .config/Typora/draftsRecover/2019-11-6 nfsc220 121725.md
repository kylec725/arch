### Why Eat?

- have to
  - physiological response
  - hunger
- want to
  - psycho-social response
  - appetite
  - stress, habit, special occasions, social norms

### Hunger (Physiological Response)

- the hypothalamus regulates hunger
- hormones
  - **Ghrelin** from stomach, a major physiological hunger signal
  - **Leptin** from adipose (fat) tissue, suppresses the desire to eat
  - **Neuropeptide Y** from hypothalamus - a neurotransmitter
- Other factors affecting hunger
  - composition of meals - fiber and water more filling, high protein vs high carbohydrates
  - income, population size (distribution/availability of food)
  - natural environment
  - technology available for food
- psycho-social response - can be a reward, coping device, or stress reliever

### Classes of Nutrients

- macro-nutrients
  - proteins
  - carbohydrates
  - lipids (fats)
- micro-nutrients
  - vitamins
  - minerals
  - water

**Kilocalorie (kcal) - unit of energy (heat)**

- Proteins
- Carbohydrates
- Fat (has more than the other two)
- Alcohol (less than fat but more than proteins and carbohydrates)
- Vitamins, minerals, and water do not provide energy

**Bomb Calorimeter** is used to measure calories in food

Adults are usually recommended to have less fat than adolescents

Some foods may contain beneficial non-nutrients called **phytochemicals**

### Diets

**Ketogenic Diet** (fad diet?)

Uses **Ketosis** a state where you body mainly metabolizes fat for energy

Ketosis can happen naturally:

- after exercising for a long time
- during pregnancy
- uncontrolled diabetes (sign of not using enough insulin)
- consequence of very low carbohydrate diet

**Testing Nutrition of Foods**

- often people disagree on how to test for the nutrition values of foods
- most people don't know how to even start testing food

**Key to evaluate nutrition information**:

1. Credibility and source of information
2. Research Methodology
   - Study design, statistical methods
   - Limitations
3. Target Group
   - Which population groups are most affected by the findings?

**Case Reports / Case Series**

- Generally report a new or unique finding from a presentation of a single case
- Advantages
  * useful for hypothesis generation
  * informative for very rare diseases
  * characterizes averages for disorder
- Disadvantages
  - Cannot study cause/effect relationships
  - Cannot assess disease frequency
- Case Report: one case of unusual findings
- Case Series: multiple cases of findings

**Descriptive Epidemiology Study**: population-based cases with denominator

**Observational Studies**:

- non-experimental
- individuals can be observed prospectively, retrospectively, or currently
- can generate hypothesis, should not draw any conclusions usually however

**Cross-sectional Studies**: "observational" design that looks at a disease's status at a single point in time

**Case-control Studies**:

- "observational" design that compares exposure between disease cases vs healthy controls form the same population
- Exposure data is collected retrospectively, thus some information may be inaccurate as it is provided by the subjects
- most feasible design where disease outcomes are rare
- can be thrown off when people in a group already have a predisposition to a certain disease

**Cohort Study**:

- "observational" design
- usually collect prospectively (sometimes retrospectively)
- compare two groups who do and do not have a condition (try to match them closely in age, general, and other key variables) otherwise, the differences can account for why someone has a given condition

### 06

**Experimental Studies**

- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
  - assign subjects randomly to "treatment" and "control" groups
  - most convincing way to prove causation
  - Clinical trials are the most well known experimental design and use randomly assigned data
  - Note: Community trials use non-random data
  - Disadvantages:
    - is usually expensive
    - may not be suitable to answer certain types of questions

### 09

**Obesity**

- Body Mass Index is generally used to determine obesity as it usually correlates with people being overweight
- Culture, diet, and poverty play roles in why countries' obesity rates are low or high
- *Social inequalities* are strong, especially among women. Less educated women are 2-3 times more likely to be overweight

What causes overweight/obesity?

- environment
- genes and family history
- health conditions
- emotional factors
- age
- lack of sleep

### 11

Obesity Health Effects:

- high blood pressure
- diabetes
- heart disease, stroke
- joint problems
- sleep apnea, respiratory problems
- increased risk of cancer
- metabolic syndrome
- mental issues (depression, anxiety, stigma, etc)

9.4% of national health care expenditures are directly related to obesity/physical inactivity

Each culture has unique:

- gender role
- body image
- family structure
- perceptions (knowledge, attitudes, values, belief)

### 13

**Acculturation**: how people change when they move to a different culture

- bi-dimensional process
- individuals may adopt certain aspects of the dominant culture
- possible relationship with diet

**Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Obesity**

- there is a strong link between lower socioeconomic status and higher obesity rates
- those with lower SES tend to have less access to healthier food alternatives

The association between obesity, income, or education level is complex and differs by sex and race.

Overall, men and women with college degrees had lower prevalence compared to those with less education.

**Health disparity** is a particular health difference that should not exist in the population

- closely linked with social or economic disadvantage
- results from multiple factors such as: poverty, environmental threats, inadequate access to health care, individual and behavioral factors

### 16

Population obesity is a product of our **environment**

Settings:

- family
  - availability of fruits and vegetables, eating meals as a family
  - low-income families have additional barriers
- work-sites/schools
  - school meal programs & BMI in children
  - competitive foods and beverages
- neighborhoods
  - presence or lack of nearby supermarkets, restaurants, etc.

**food desert** - area with limited access to affordable and nutritious foods

possible strategies to mitigate poor food choice:

- change food selection
- adjust food price
- restructure food aisle layouts

### 18

**The Cheeseburger Bill**

- 26 states have enacted "commonsense consumption" laws
  - prohibit people from suing restaurants for making them fat
  - implies that the food industry does not have to worry about public health

Models to explain obesity

1. Medical model - focus on treatment, try to address individuals' personal behavior
2. Public health model - concentrate on prevention

Note: tension between empowering individuals to manage weight and blaming them for failure to do so.

Current recommendations:

Lifestyle therapy - teaching how to eat and exercise properly

Behavioral therapy - goal setting

Clinical therapies - clinical intervention

### 20

**Pharmacotherpay for Weight Loss**

- adjunct to diet & physical activity
- should not be use for cosmetic weight loss
  - only for risk reduction
- use only when 6-month trial of diet and exercise is not effective
- work by decreasing appetite or increasing feelings of fullness
- monitoring is necessary
- side effects (increase in heart rate, blood pressure vomiting, nausea, etc.)

**Weight Loss Surgery**

1. Restrictive Surgery - uses bands or staples to create food intake restriction
2. Combined Restrictive and Malabsorptive Surgery - Limits food intake, alters digestion

**Heart Disease**

- Coronary artery disease
  - leading cause of deaths
  - occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart
  - plaque is made up of cholesterol deposits
- Risk factors
  - smoking
  - high LDL (low density lipoprotein) (main cause)
  - hypertension
  - diabetes
  - overweight and obesity
  - poor diet & physical inactivity
  - excessive alcohol use

**Unhealthy Fats**

1. Saturated
2. Trans

**Healthier Fats**

- Unsaturated
- Monounsaturated
- Polyunsaturated
- Omega-3 fatty acids

### 30

To improve cholesterol:

- heart-healthy foods
  - reduce saturated fats
  - eliminate trans fats
  - omega-3 fatty acids
  - increase soluble fiber

Can cholesterol level be too low?

- not been confirmed
- very rarely may be associated with risk of cancer, depression, anxiety
- overall it seems to be beneficial to have lower levels

**Carbohydrates**

- sugar
- starch: not a simple sugar
- fiber: tend to be parts of plants that are indigestible

**Hypertension**

- blood pressure that is usually too high
- means the heart is working too hard
- Systolic BP - force of blood in the arteries as the heart contracts
- Diastolic BP - force of blood in the arteries as the heart relaxes
- cannot be cured
- associated with - risk factor
  - heart attack
  - stroke
  - chronic heart failure

Causes:

- genetics
- age
- lifestyle
  - body weight
  - high sodium intake
  - inadequate potassium intake
  - physical inactivity
  - excessive alcohol consumption, smoking

Note: blood pressure can vary

### 02

**Diabetes**

- chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes glucose
- no cure for type 2
- losing weight, eating well, exercising can help manage disease
- diabetes medications or insulin therapy can be used
- notes:
  - lack of insulin secretion
  - increased insulin resistance
  - elevated plasma glucose levels
  - abnormal carbohydrate, lipid metabolism

Hemoglobin A1c

- below 5.7 (normal)
- 6.5 or higher (diabetes)

### 04

**Cancer**

- malignant - cells become invasive to surrounding tissue
- benign - cells remain local
- causes
  - genes may influence risk
  - factors that can be changed are body weight, diet, and physical activity
- risk factors
  - age
  - alcohol
  - chronic inflammation
  - hormones
  - diet, obesity
  - radiation
  - sunlight
  - tobacco

Phytochemicals may help protect against cancer

Taking supplements may not be more healthful than following a healthy diet

Limiting red meat intake may be helpful (processed meats with sodium or nitrates)

### 09

**Eating Disorders**

- anorexia
- bulimia
  - can lead to abnormal heart rhythm
  - teeth erosion
- binge eating
  - periods of restriction generally followed by periods of binging

All eating disorders require professional help:

- physician
- psychiatrist
- registered dietitian

Recovery rates better for bulimia vs. anorexia

### 16

**Revolutions in Food Technology**

1. Paleolithic era
   - stone tools, use of fire, food prep
   - improvement in diet quality and diversity
   - aided in evolution
2. Agricultural Revolution
   - huge increase in available calories, expansion of population
   - caused protein and micro nutrient deficiency diseases
3. Industrial Revolution
   - allowed for mass production of refined sugar and flour

Relation to Chronic Disease

- removal of water during processing: promotes shelf life, also increases calories
  - energy density is inversely related to dietary quality and body weight (more calories, but less micro nutrients)

Big Three Ingredients Found in Processed Foods



**Government Subsidies**: support farmers to promote lower cost and high quality foods

Food technology can be targeted to help grow or cultivate food in other locations of the world.

### 21

**Vitamin and Dietary Supplements**

Three types of Label Claims:

1. Health claims
   - describe a relationship between a food substance and reduced disease risk
   - cannot be claims about the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease
   - limited to claims of risk reduction
2. Nutrient content claims
   - describe the relative amount of a nutrient or dietary substance in a product
3. Structure/Function claims
   - does not require FDA approval
   - must provide 2 disclaimers

### 25

Who requires supplements?

- those on restricted diets: vegetarians, vegans, etc.
- elderly
- those with diseases such as celiac

Athletes may want to take supplements if they have specific weight restrictions.

### 01

What is a food system?

- **Inputs**: the natural resources and methods that go into creating food
- **Participants**: the people who consume the food, create, transport, etc.

**Conventional**: allows to mass production of food

**Sustainable**: not requiring to mass produce and instead being efficient in food consumption

### 04

Farmer subsidies are used to ensure there is not a shortage of certain foods

**Food miles**: distance a food product travels from its creation to destination

**Sustainable Food System**:

- lower miles traveled
- local foods
- local production and distribution
- Farmers Markets
- community support agriculture
- small, diversified farms
- sustainable eating

Composting can help reduce food waste in landfills

### 06

**Food Insecurity**

- access by all members at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life
- availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods
- acquire food in socially acceptable ways

Four Pillars

1. Physical availability of food
2. Economic and physical access to food
3. Food Utilization
4. Stability of the other 3 dimensions over time

Most compelling reason for hunger is poverty!

Causes

- poverty
- unemployment
- homelessness
- functional illiteracy
- poor health
- mental health problems

Characteristics of Households with higher prevalence of food insecurity

- headed by single mothers
- poverty level income
- black and Hispanic households
- disabled adults, older adults
- large cities and rural areas
