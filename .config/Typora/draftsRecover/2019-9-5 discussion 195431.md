1. The image that Ingres' painting creates very clearly emphasizes the superiority that the male Greek gods hold over the females. In the image, no only is Zeus significantly larger in size that Thetis, he is also in a clear position of power, sitting on top of a throne. Thetis almost seems to be begging for Zeus' help while he sits there uncaring and all-powerful.
2. Zeus does many things to anger Hera, and while his actions are not necessarily justified, his inability sometimes to reconcile with Hera is understandable due to Hera's position as his wife. The previous events with Gaia and Ouranos, and Cronus and Rhea present a clear pattern betrayal between husband and wife. This fact is enough to cast doubt into Zeus' mind.
3. Hera may be believed to originally be an earth goddess due to her possession of the power of parthenogenesis, or reproduction without fertilization, an ability possessed by Gaea. She is also the patron of childbirth, similarly enough to Gaea. In some stories she was even said to have been the mother of Typhoeus, whereas most other stories have Gaea as the mother.
