The infographic that I have provided below is meant to give the reader basic information and statistics about elephants. The topic is made clear by the large-font header at the top of the page that reads "Elephants." More specifically, the graphic aims to drive readers to learn how these animals can be protected.

 A majority of the information presented appear to be scientific fact, ranging from the average diet of elephants to their average lifespan. The map near the top showing where elephants are normally found is very clear cut and easy to understand. In fact a majority of the information provided include relevant graphics along with the text information. The video we were provided discussed how it was best to bring well-backed information to the infographic which is what appears to be in the one I have chosen.

I felt that this infographic had a strong composition of colors and presented the information in an easy-to-read format that many readers will benefit from. The combination of different font-sizes and location of different groups and clusters show an understanding of composing graphical content.
