1. Achilles makes his decision to fight and die young because of Patroclus' death, he feels the need to avenge his friend fulfill the Greek law of ethics to "help your friends, hurt your enemies". It can be seen that he has reached anagnorisis when he tells one of his victims that however heroic, he himself will die, showing that he has acknowledged his fate fully.
2. Hephaestos depicted the two contrasting scenes of peace and war on Achilles' shield to illustrate the choice that Achilles was faced with: to choose a long life of peace, or to go to war and die early. Achilles reacted to the scenes passionately because of his clarity in his future, he realized that he had made his choice to pursue a heroic ending.
3. The scene of Priam and Achilles shows to me that Achilles' actions of deep violence are only done through his grief and loyalty to his friends. It shows that he is not merely a creature of rage and revenge. I do feel like it is an appropriate ending as it somewhat shows that Achilles has come to terms with what has happened to Patroclus, and can give back Hector's body as a symbol of that. His loss of Patroclus and his actions to avenge his friend show the tragedy that Achilles feels and has experienced and his heroic qualities of loyalty to his friends.
