Baltimore Avenue at the University of Maryland is an extremely busy area; being the location for several bars and restaurants that large portion of students frequent. I would like to propose to College Park city officials that more safety measures be put into place such as more fences, traffic officers, stricter regulations on local businesses, and possibly construction. I personally see several dangerous situations on Baltimore Avenue and would feel safer myself if some of these changes were implemented.
