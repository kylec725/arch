This article looks at the ability for Neuromuscular and Proprioceptive training to reduce knee injuries. Looking at the results of 24 studies with 1093 participants, neuromuscular and proprioceptive training helped to reduce knee injury significantly. While no specific exercise was seen to be more beneficial, implementing these training methods seemed to definitely decrease injuries. I believe that implementing these training methods to improve athletes' body awareness and reactivity would be hugely beneficial to their health, more specifically in my club Terpwushu.
