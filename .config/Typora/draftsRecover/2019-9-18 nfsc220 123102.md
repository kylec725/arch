# Nutrition and Food Science

### Why Eat?

- have to
  - physiological response
  - hunger
- want to
  - psycho-social response
  - appetite
  - stress, habit, special occasions, social norms

### Hunger (Physiological Response)

- the hypothalamus regulates hunger
- hormones
  - **Ghrelin** from stomach, a major physiological hunger signal
  - **Leptin** from adipose (fat) tissue, suppresses the desire to eat
  - **Neuropeptide Y** from hypothalamus - a neurotransmitter
- Other factors affecting hunger
  - composition of meals - fiber and water more filling, high protein vs high carbohydrates
  - income, population size (distribution/availability of food)
  - natural environment
  - technology available for food
- psycho-social response - can be a reward, coping device, or stress reliever

### Classes of Nutrients

- macro-nutrients
  - proteins
  - carbohydrates
  - lipids (fats)
- micro-nutrients
  - vitamins
  - minerals
  - water

**Kilocalorie (kcal) - unit of energy (heat)**

- Proteins
- Carbohydrates
- Fat (has more than the other two)
- Alcochol (less than fat but more than proteins and carbohydrates)
- Vitamins, minerals, and water do not provide energy

**Bomb Calorimeter** is used to measure calories in food

Adults are usually recommended to have less fat than adolescents

Some foods may contain beneficial non-nutrients called **phytochemicals**

### Diets

**Ketogenic Diet** (fad diet?)

Uses **Ketosis** a state where you body mainly metabolizes fat for energy

Ketosis can happen naturally:

- after exercising for a long time
- during pregnancy
- uncontrolled diabetes (sign of not using enough insulin)
- consequence of very low carbohydrate diet

**Testing Nutrition of Foods**

- often people disagree on how to test for the nutrition values of foods
- most people don't know how to even start testing food

**Key to evaluate nutrition information**:

1. Credibility and source of information
2. Research Methodology
   - Study design, statistical methods
   - Limitations
3. Target Group
   - Which population groups are most affected by the findings?

**Case Reports / Case Series**

- Generally report a new or unique finding from a presentation of a single case
- Advantages
  * useful for hypothesis generation
  * informative for very rare diseases
  * characterizes averages for disorder
- Disadvantages
  - Cannot study cause/effect relationships
  - Cannot assess disease frequency
- Case Report: one case of unusual findings
- Case Series: multiple cases of findings

**Descriptive Epidemiology Study**: population-based cases with denominator

**Observational Studies**:

- non-experimental
- individuals can be observed prospectively, retrospectively, or currently
- can generate hypothesis, should not draw any conclusions usually however

**Cross-sectional Studies**: "observational" design that looks at a disease's status at a single point in time

**Case-control Studies**:

- "observational" design that compares exposure between disease cases vs healthy controls form the same population
- Exposure data is collected retrospectively, thus some information may be inaccurate as it is provided by the subjects
- most feasible design where disease outcomes are rare
- can be thrown off when people in a group already have a predisposition to a certain disease

**Cohort Study**:

- "observational" design
- usually collect prospectively (sometimes retrospectively)
- compare two groups who do and do not have a condition (try to match them closely in age, general, and other key variables) otherwise, the differences can account for why someone has a given condition

### 06

**Experimental Studies**

- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
  - assign subjects randomly to "treatment" and "control" groups
  - most convincing way to prove causation
  - Clinical trials are the most well known experimental design and use randomly assigned data
  - Note: Community trials use non-random data
  - Disadvantages:
    - is usually expensive
    - may not be suitable to answer certain types of questions

### 09

**Obesity**

- Body Mass Index is generally used to determine obesity as it usually correlates with people being overweight
- Culture, diet, and poverty play roles in why countries' obesity rates are low or high
- *Social inequalities* are strong, especially among women. Less educated women are 2-3 times more likely to be overweight

What causes overweight/obesity?

- environment
- genes and family history
- health conditions
- emotional factors
- age
- lack of sleep

### 11

Obesity Health Effects:

- high blood pressure
- diabetes
- heart disease, stroke
- joint problems
- sleep apnea, respiratory problems
- increased risk of cancer
- metabolic syndrome
- mental issues (depression, anxiety, stigma, etc)

9.4% of national health care expenditures are directly related to obesity/physical inactivity

Each culture has unique:

- gender role
- body image
- family structure
- perceptions (knowledge, attitudes, values, belief)

### 13

**Acculturation**: how people change when they move to a different culture

- bi-dimensional process
- individuals may adopt certain aspects of the dominant culture
- possible relationship with diet

**Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Obesity**

- there is a strong link between lower socioeconomic status and higher obesity rates
- those with lower SES tend to have less access to healthier food alternatives

The association between obesity, income, or education level is complex and differs by sex and race.

Overall, men and women with college degrees had lower prevalence compared to those with less education.

**Health disparity** is a particular health difference that should not exist int he population

- closely linked with social or economic disadvantage
- results from multiple factors such as: poverty, environmental threats, inadequate access to health care, individual and behavioral factors

### 16

Population obesity is a product of our **environment**

Settings:

- family
  - availability of fruits and vegetables, eating meals as a family
  - low-income families have additional barriers
- work-sites/schools
  - school meal programs & BMI in children
  - competitive foods and beverages
- neighborhoods
  - presence or lack of nearby supermarkets, restaurants, etc.

**food desert** - area with limited access to affordable and nutritious foods

possible strategies to mitigate poor food choice:

- change food selection
- adjust food price
- restructure food aisle layouts

### 18

**The Cheeseburger Bill**

- 26 states have enacted "commonsense consumption" laws
  - prohibit people from suing restaurants for making them fat
  - implies that the food industry does not have to worry about public health

Models to explain obesity

1. Medical model - focus on treatment, try to address individuals' personal behavior
2. Public health model - concentrate on prevention

Note: tension between empowering individuals to manage weight and blaming them for failure to do so.

Current recommendations:

Lifestyle therapy - teaching how to eat and exercise properly

Behavioral therapy - goal setting

Clinical therapies
