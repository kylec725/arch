The aspect of usability is especially interesting when signaling structural relationships. For example, the writer may choose too display an unrelated, but important fact in a jarringly different format, such as extremely small or large font. This large contrast pulls the reader's attention to the piece of information, and the unique formatting may make it more memorable. However, using this style too often may result in the reader ignoring the "unique" bit of information, as well as make the entire piece unattractive to read. Instead, the writer must contrast the "usability" of text in moderation, to more effectively capture the reader's attention.
