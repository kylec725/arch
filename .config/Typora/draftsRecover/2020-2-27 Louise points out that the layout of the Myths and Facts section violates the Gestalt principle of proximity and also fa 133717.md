Louise points out that the layout of the Myths and Facts section violates the Gestalt principle of proximity and also fails to cluster related topics effectively in general. The heading "Healthy Eating?" is strangely close to the Myths and Facts text, suggesting a closer relationship for no particular reason. Additionally, the Myths and Facts headers should be closer to their respective lists to more accurately depict their proximity in topic. The lists use bullets, and lead the reader to go down the list, instead of comparing the respective myth versus fact. Miguel could possibly use a table or some other visual aid to show the comparison between myth and fact. Lastly, the photo column on the left side throws off the focus of the page, the myth and fact columns should be more centered to highlight their focus as the topic.
