1. Dionysus takes the disguise of a regular mortal in order to convince humans that of his teachings. King Pentheus changes clothing into female clothing in order to not be recognized as the king.
2. Pentheus is similar to Dionysus in terms of their heritage, as they are both grandsons of Cadmus, and both have similarly androgynous physical qualities.  They also have similar confident personalities, acting somewhat haughty at times. Pentheus' abilities are notably weaker than Dionysus' however, as Dionysus is a fully-fledged god.
3. I feel that Pentheus has an anagnorisis when Dionysus reveals his presence and identity somewhere near line 1335. At that point he recognizes Dionysus' true identity as a god.
4. Dionysus' road into godhood began with tragedy when his mother was initially killed by seeing Zeus' true form. Similarly his interactions with Pentheus killed the king tragically as well, showing how his meddling could so easily lead to tragedy for others.
