1. Freud believes that in Sophocles' play, Oedipus' mother is described to have connected Oedipus' incestuous desire with dream fulfillment, explaining the plot to tackle the wish fulfillment idea of incest.
2. Freud is describing the play to be similar to psychoanalysis as he believes that the narrative observes the fulfillment of a childhood wish. The story describes how a person must fight against their childhood urges and how these incestuous wishes have been repressed into people's minds.
3. Based off of Oedipus' myth, I do not believe that he has an Oedipal complex. In the story, he does in fact kill his father, but not with the knowledge that the man he has killed is his father. And while he does marry his mother and they have children together, he is unaware that the woman is his mother. I do not feel that his situation is the result of his desire for his mother and hate for his father, it is instead rather circumstantial and happens out of "fate".
