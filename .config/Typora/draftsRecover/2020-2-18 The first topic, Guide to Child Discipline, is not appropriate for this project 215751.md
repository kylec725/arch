The first topic, Guide to Child Discipline, is not appropriate for this project. The audience for this topic is very broad, and the writer does not list very credible experiences to justify their position as a teacher. Furthermore, their proposed solution says that "my research will help me to determine this, but maybe a guide or workshop with solution", this makes the writer appear to have no idea what an actual solution would be to their already broad problem of child discipline. This topic could be improved by isolating a specific problem encountered when trying to raise a child, then proposing a concrete solution or strategy to deal with the problem.

The second topic, Women in STEM, targets the issue of low proportion of women within the STEM fields. This topic is much more appropriate for this topic as it allows the writer to come up with a much more specific solution, in this case, a career day geared towards females within the STEM field. This solution is able to be targeted towards a specific audience, the Red Creek High School Principal, allowing the proposal to the solution to be much more effective. e
