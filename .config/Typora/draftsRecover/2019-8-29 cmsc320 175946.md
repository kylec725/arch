Classical Types of Data

**Categorical**

- nominal
  * values have names (describe the categories, classes, states)
  * marital status, drink type, or some binary attribute
  * cannot compare easily, thus cannot naturally order them
- ordinal
  * values have names (describe the categories, classes, states)
  * however there is ordering over the values
  * lacks a mathematical notion of distance between the values

**Numerical**

- interval
  * scale with fixed but arbitrary interval
  * the difference/distance between values is meaningful
  * cannot compute ratio or scales
- ratio
  * same as interval, but the *ratio* between items can observed unlike interval
  * there is a "zero" absolute
