I definitely agree with your view that the first topic of child discipline is not not specific enough. With a topic that can have so much variation in the problems present and what may be deemed an appropriate solution, the author should have specified a smaller audience. I do think that another possibility would have been to specify a certain situation or scenario to discuss how different disciplinary actions may be effective. This is especially true with the variation of cultures or personality as you have stated.
