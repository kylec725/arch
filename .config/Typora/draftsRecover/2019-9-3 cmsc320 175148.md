### Classical Types of Data

**Categorical**

- nominal
  * values have names (describe the categories, classes, states)
  * marital status, drink type, or some binary attribute
  * cannot compare easily, thus cannot naturally order them
- ordinal
  * values have names (describe the categories, classes, states)
  * however there is ordering over the values
  * lacks a mathematical notion of distance between the values

**Numerical**

- interval
  * scale with fixed but arbitrary interval
  * the difference/distance between values is meaningful
  * cannot compute ratio or scales
- ratio
  * same as interval, but the *ratio* between items can observed unlike interval
  * there is a "zero" absolute

### Data Manipulation and Computation

**Data Representation** what is the natural way to think about given data

**Data Processing Operations** which take one or more datasets as input and produce one or more datasets as output

### Collecting Data

Five ways to get data:

- Direct download and load from local storage
- generate locally via downloaded code (e.g. simulation)
- query data from a database
- create a new entry or objectquery an API from the intra/internet
- scrape data from a webpage

**REST API's**

- **GET**: perform query, return data
- **POST**: create a new entry or object
- **PUT**: update an existing entry or object
- **DELETE**: delete an existing entry or object

Will be **stateless**, meaning that with every request you send a token/authentication of who you are.

What does a GET request return?

- General Structured Data
  - Comma-Separated Value (CSV)
  - Javascript Object NOtation (JSON)
  - HTML, XHTML, XML files & strings
- Domain-Specific Structured Data
  - Shapefiles: geospatial vector data (OpenStreetMap)
  - RVT files: architectural planning

**GRAPHQL**

- an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures

- allows a user to request a specific structure for the data they are requesting
- makes the workload heavier server-side

**JSON Files & Strings**

- serialize an object into a string
- deserialize a string back into an object
- easy to read and powerful

**Document Object Model (DOM)**
