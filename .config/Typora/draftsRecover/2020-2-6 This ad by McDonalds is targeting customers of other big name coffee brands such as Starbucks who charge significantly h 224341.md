This ad by McDonalds is targeting customers of other big name coffee brands such as Starbucks who charge significantly higher prices for their coffee. The intended audience is those who like to have coffee or espresso, but value cost and convenience. The wording "four bucks is dumb" is meant to draw in those who may be less picky about the taste and quality of their espresso beverage and instead simply want a quick cup of coffee for their day. McDonalds is an extremely well known brand, and the audience will not expect breathtaking service, which will then be made up to them for cost and convenience. This ad is intended to reach coffee drinkers who desire quick and inexpensive coffee.
